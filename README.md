# 📊 MyBankDB - Banking Database Project

Welcome to the **MyBankDB** project – a simulated banking database system built using structured CSV data tables and SQL queries. This project is ideal for practicing data querying, reporting, and analysis with real-world banking scenarios.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project contains a relational database schema for a fictional bank named **MyBankDB**, designed to simulate typical operations and data points found in a banking environment. It includes customers, accounts, transactions, loans, credit cards, branches, and ATMs.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Details

A total of **7 CSV files** have been uploaded and used as tables in the MyBankDB database:

* `customers.csv` – Customer information
* `accounts.csv` – Bank account data
* `transactions.csv` – Transaction records
* `loans.csv` – Loan details
* `creditcards.csv` – Credit card data
* `branches.csv` – Bank branch information
* `atms.csv` – ATM details

These datasets are assumed to be clean and ready for ingestion into a MySQL-compatible database.

## 🏗️ Database Schema

The project includes SQL statements to:

* **Create** the `mybankdb` database
* **Use** and query various tables
* **Join** related tables for analytical insights
* **Aggregate** data (e.g., total loans, customer counts)
* **Filter** using conditions (e.g., active accounts, high loan interest)
* **Group and Sort** data to derive useful business metrics
* **Create backups**, calculate derived columns, and more

## 📌 Example Insights Queried

* Total number of customers, accounts, and transactions
* Loan and credit card limits summation
* Customers with multiple accounts
* Customers' age-based segmentation
* High-value loan holders
* Inactive accounts and ATMs
* Time-based transaction analysis
* Customer-account-transaction relationships
